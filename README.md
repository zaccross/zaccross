- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @zaccross

- I am a Master's Student at the University of Oregon in Applied Physics, currently working as an intern at KLA Tencor.
- My github is a collection of all of my programming projects from coursework and personal interests!

- Currently, I am trying to build my Machine Learning skills, working through the Berkley AI class's pac-man projects, and several of the UOs classes on data science and CS. 

- My goal is to find a way to connect my programming and my passion for Physics and other sciences to do something meaningful and interesting. (...And maybe a little sci fi too :) )

- Feel free to peruse my repositories. They are in no particular order, and my formatting / style / documentation definitely varies project to project, though I am trying to be more neat and consistent with current projects. 

- I am always happy to talk about programming, science, and other topics too, so send me an email at zachcross43@gmail.com for questions and comments!

- Thanks :)
